# MUnity
Unity Music Player

### This music player is only available for `Unity Editor`. This project uses [`UnityEditor`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/UnityEditor.html) namespace.

##### This Unity project is my first Unity project. My Unity skills such as source code and GUI are not good enough, so the quality is poor.
Pull Requests and Issues are always welcome!

#### 1. Download `Unity 2019.4.17f1` (recommended version).

#### 3. Add a project from Unity Hub or Unity and enter the project.
#### 4. When you are done loading, press the Play button in the upper center.
